# Cyclistic-Case-Study
This is my report on the Cyclistic Case Study taken from the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.

In this repository, you will find the following:
- All data used for this project, namely the trailing twelve months data of Cyclistic - a fictional bike sharing company. This data was pulled from the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.
- A R Markdown file which consists of my R code, visualisations, analysis and recommendations
- A html report containing my final report
