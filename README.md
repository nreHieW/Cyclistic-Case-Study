This is my report on the Cyclistic Case Study taken from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

In this repository, you will find the following:
- All data used for this project, namely the trailing twelve months data of Cyclistic - a fictional bike sharing company. This data was pulled from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.
- A R Markdown file which consists of my R code, visualisations, analysis and recommendations
- A pdf file "Output.pdf" that contains my report and the code
- A pdf report "Final Report.pdf" containing my final report
